<!-- Workspace-specific Copilot instructions for this project. -->

This repository contains a full-stack application with a Java Spring Boot backend and a Vite + React + TypeScript frontend.

General Guidelines:
- Use idiomatic, modern best practices for both Java (Spring Boot) and React + TypeScript.
- Keep backend code in the `backend` directory and frontend code in the `frontend` directory.
- For the frontend, place all React components and logic in the `frontend/src` directory. Use Vite conventions for configuration and static assets.
- For the backend, follow standard Maven and Spring Boot project structure. Place Java source files in `backend/src/main/java` and resources in `backend/src/main/resources`.
- Use RESTful API design for backend endpoints.
- Ensure clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend.
- Write clear, maintainable, and well-documented code.
- Use environment variables or configuration files for secrets and environment-specific settings.
- Add tests in the appropriate test directories (`backend/src/test/java` for backend, `frontend/src` for frontend tests).
